The process of packaging and running applications in isolated environments, such as a `container`, `virtual machine`, `serverless environment`.

Technologies include:
- [[Docker]]
- [[Docker Compose]]
- [[Linux Containers]]

Pros of containers:
- They provide ==scalability== and ==portability==.
- helps protect the host system from any malicious activities in the container while providing an additional layer of security for the applications running on the containers
- are lightweight, which makes them more difficult to compromise than traditional virtual machines
- are easy to configure, making them ideal for running applications securely.
